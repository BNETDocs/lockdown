 * 
 * Note that you can actually do *anything* here, since this is arbitrary machine code,
 * but that the change will not be undone until the program ends.

 *  code:      The code to replace the opening bytes with, see below for some examples
 *  length:    The number of bytes to replace (should be the same as the length of code)
 * 
 * Here are the most common ways to return early (be sure you match the function's 
 * real return size!):
 *  ret:    c3
 *  ret xx: c2 xx xx
 *
 * And here are some ways to set the value that's returned (be sure to follow with
 *  c3 or c2 xx xx:
 *
 * return 1:  b8 01 00 00 00 (mov eax, 1)
 * return 1:  6a 01 58       (push 1 / pop eax)

 * return -1: 33 c0 83 e8 01 (xor eax, eax / sub eax, 1)
 * return -1: 83 c8 ff       (or eax, -1)
